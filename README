~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


============================================================================
System Requirements
============================================================================
BlueCat Linux installation is performed on a pre-installed, fully operational
Linux host system. System requirements for the Linux host are as follows:
   * Linux host system;
   * Standard set of Linux utilities;
   * 100 MB of free disk.

============================================================================
Installing BlueCat Linux 
============================================================================
To install BlueCat Linux onto the Linux host system, step through the 
following procedure.

1. Untar the BlueCat downloadable image.
To do that, you have to be logged in as "root" (superuser). For instance, 

# cd /tmp
# mkdir BlueCat
# cd BlueCat
# tar xzf <image file name>

All the remaining steps of the installation procedure can be performed under 
a regular user account.

2. Go to the directory where you want to install BlueCat Linux. This directory 
must be empty. For instance:

$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir BlueCat
$ cd BlueCat

3. Run the BlueCat installation program:

$ /tmp/BlueCat/install

This program performs all necessary installation actions, which include 
the following: 
- Install the minimal set of BlueCat Linux RPM packages (both CDT and Target).
- Set correct permissions for the installed binaries.

You may also specify the path of the installation directory to the install 
program. For instance:

$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir BlueCat
$ /tmp/BlueCat/install BlueCat

When the install program has finished, the installation procedure is complete.
If you are installing BlueCat Linux onto an NFS-mounted disk, 
make sure you enable the NFS locking daemon on the NFS Server.

=============================================================================
Setting Up the Execution Environment
=============================================================================
Before you can start any BlueCat Linux development, you have to set up 
a correct execution environment. To do so, use the following procedure:
1. Go to the directory where you have installed BlueCat Linux. For instance:

$ cd $HOME/BlueCat

2. Source the shell script to set up the BlueCat Linux environment variables:

$ . SETUP.sh x86

The SETUP.sh script sets up a number of environment variables used by 
BlueCat Linux tools. These environment variables include BLUECAT_PREFIX, 
which must contain the absolute path to the BlueCat Linux installation 
directory.

=============================================================================
Demo systems
=============================================================================
Once you have installed BlueCat Linux onto your host system, you get a number 
of demonstration systems sources that reside in $BLUECAT_PREFIX/demo and can 
be booted on an embedded target. Each demo system shows a particular feature 
of BlueCat Linux. To build the demonstration systems, use the following 
commands:

BlueCat:$ cd BLUECAT_PREFIX/demo
BlueCat:$ make all 

A demo system is composed of the following components:
*  A BlueCat Linux kernel customized for the embedded system. This is 
represented by a prebuilt, compressed kernel image and a .config file that 
can be used to rebuild the kernel. You use the mkkernel tool (or equivalent) 
to build the kernel image from the .config file.
*  A root file system containing the tools and custom programs, required for 
the demo system to bootstrap and run. This is represented by a prebuilt, 
compressed root file system image and an mkrootfs specification file that 
can be used to rebuild the root file system. You use the mkrootfs tool 
to build the root file system image from the .spec file.
*  Optionally, custom applications and files developed specially for the demo 
system, such as sample application programs.

Using Makefile to Rebuild a Demo System
========================================
Use Makefile in the demo system directory to rebuild the system images.
A typical Makefile includes the following goals:

Target		Description
------------------------------------------
kernel	- Builds <demo>.kernel and <demo>.disk
rootfs	- Builds <demo>.rfs and <demo>.tar
kdi	- Builds <demo>.kdi
this	- Builds custom programs in src/
all	- Builds all the goals above
xconfig	- Copies <demo>.config to the kernel .config, calls make xconfig, 
          and copies the updated kernel .config into <demo>.config
clean	- Removes all prebuilt binaries

Running Demo System
===================
You can boot a demo system on the target system from one of the following 
devices, depending on the boot options supported by your BlueCat Linux 
target system:

Booting from a Floppy Disk
--------------------------
1) Install demo on a floppy from host using mkboot
2) Boot target from floppy disk	
For detailed explanation of how to install demo on a floppy, refer to 
the mkboot command reference: 

BlueCat:$ man mkboot

Booting from a Hard Disk
------------------------
1) Install demo on a hard disk from host using mkboot
2) Boot target from hard disk	
For detailed explanation of how to install demo on a hard disk, refer to 
the mkboot command reference: 

BlueCat:$ man mkboot

Booting from ROM/Flash	
----------------------
1) Install demo to ROM/Flash using firmware or external,
device-specific tools
2) Boot target from ROM/Flash

Booting BlueCat Linux on x86 from ROM/Flash:

Install BlueCat Linux ROM Boot BIOS as an extension BIOS using 
Flash and BIOS management tools provided with your target hardware. 
The BlueCat Linux ROM Boot BIOS image romboot.img is located in 
$BLUECAT_PREFIX/boot/ directory.

The BlueCat Linux ROM Boot BIOS image included in your distribution 
is an example of a Boot BIOS developed to support booting of BlueCat 
Linux on one of the reference embedded targets based on the x86 
architecture (PC-680 Mobile Industrial ComputerTM of Octagon Systems 
Corporation). You may need to make changes in the Boot BIOS code to 
support specifics of your custom target hardware. Refer to the 
comments in the source files of the ROM Boot BIOS residing in 
$BLUECAT_PREFIX/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/romboot.

Program the demo image (<demo>.kdi) into Flash using 
Flash and BIOS management tools provided with your target hardware.

Enable support for extension BIOS on the target, either in BIOS or 
using on-board jumpers, depending on your target hardware.

Reset your target system. BlueCat Linux will boot from ROM/Flash.
